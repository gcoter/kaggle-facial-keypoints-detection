# Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection
The goal of this repository is to store the different models I tried so far for the Kaggle Facial Keypoints Detection competition.

## Models
I took inspiration from the Deep Learning tutorial associated to this competition. So far, I have tried two models:

* One Hidden Layer Neural Network
* Convolutional Neural Network

I am going to test the CNN on a machine with GPU. I will probably modify it.
